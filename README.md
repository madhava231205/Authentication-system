# Authentication-system

hi everyone, this repository contains the code which i used to make a authenication system which contains a simple basic signup and login portal
i covered only frontened part for this system in this repository
Through HTML,CSS and Javascript i build this system
In html i used the all basic elements like headings,division,hyperlinks, buttons,input tags etc...
In CSS i used all basic styles to make the system look neat
finally i used little bit of javascript to make this system responsive.
